# Zetachain Hello World

A simple cross-chain counter app using [ZetaChain Message Passing API](https://staging.docs.zetachain.com/develop/api-reference/messaging-api/).

The counters are address-based and each address can only increment its own counter.

## Try it in testnet

The collection is currently deployed to [BSC Testnet](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/) and [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/), the contracts are verified so you can use BscScan and Etherscan to play with them.

### Incrementing your counter

1. Go to the [BSC Testnet contract's write methods](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/#writeContract).
1. Connect with your wallet.
